# YTPMVE-Redux
YTPMVE-Redux is a different take on Cantersoft's [YTPMVE](https://github.com/Cantersoft/YTPMVE). Instead of switching from C# to Python and back to C#, I just used a C# MIDI parser from [here](https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/midi-parser).

If you *really* want to make MIDI replaces as "YTPMV", use Otomad Helper. This is just a proof of concept right now.
